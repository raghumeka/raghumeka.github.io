<div style="float:left; width:800px; margin-left:0em">
<font size="4"> The course will cover the basics as well as some of
  the state-of-the-art results in pseudoranodmness, explicit
  constructions in combinatorics, and their applications. The main
  goal is to introduce the many fascinating questions and ideas in
  pseudorandomness and to cover versatile tools that are useful in
  other areas such as discrete mathematics (e.g., expanders),
  algorithms (e.g., hashing, streaming algorithms), and cryptography
  (extractors, hardness vs randomness).

  <strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Basic knowledge of probability will
  be the most helpful. The students are expected to be mathematically mature
  and be able to follow and write down formal proofs. Familiarity with
  discrete mathematics, combinatorics, and undergraduate-level algorithms will be helpful.<br><br>

  <strong>Course work</strong>: We will have three
  assignments (15% each), one mid-term (25%), and one final (30%). The
  grading will also be flexible: students can, if they choose to,
  exchange an homework for more scribing duties or an approved
  research project (that can also be counted towards the report) for the final exam.<br><br>

    <strong>Policy and required text</strong>: There will be no makeup
  exams for the course; the mid-term will be held in class. A
  reference for several lectures is the book <a
  href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~salil/pseudorandomness/">Pseudorandomness</a>
  by Salil Vadhan. Links to appropriate papers or other online material (typically other lecture notes) will be provided for each
  lecture. <br><br>
</div>

<strong>Academic honesty</strong>: The students are expected to fully
abide by UCLA's student conduct <a
href="http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/soc/notices.htm">policies</a>,
including Section 102.01 on academic honesty. You will find a wealth
of helpful materials <a
href="http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/dos/students/integrity/">here</a>,
including the <a
href="http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/dos/assets/documents/StudentGuide.pdf">Student
Guide to Academic Integrity</a>. Academic dishonesty will be promptly
reported to the Dean of Students' Office for adjudication and
disciplinary action. Remember, cheating will have significant and
irrevocable consequences for your academic record and professional
future. Please don't cheat.

<br><br>While collaboration with other students on
assignments is fine, each student must write their solutions independently and
should clearly mention the collaborators. You should never share
your written solutions with someone else or copy from someone else's
written solutions. Under no circumstances may you use solution sets to
problems from previous year courses or from similar courses elsewhere
or other resoruces on the web.<br><br>
