  <strong>Course goals</strong><br>   The course will cover the basics of design and analysis of algorithms. The primary goal of the course is to develop ''algorithmic thinking''. Along the way we will learn some of the core algorithmic techniques and concrete algorithms that underlie much of computer science; we will cover some very important and blazingly fast algorithms. The course will be both challenging (as evidenced by the incomplete list of topics below) and exciting! 
  <br><br>
  <strong> Homework (6 x 3%)</strong>. Tentative scopes of the assignments: 1 - Lectures
  1-3; 2 - Lectures 4-6; 3 - Lectures 7-9; 4 - Lectures 10-12; 5 -
  Lectures 13-15; 6 - Lectures 16-18.<br><br>

  <strong> Quizzes (10 x 1%)</strong>. There will be a short weekly
  online quiz that will go live on CCLE every Wednesday at 6PM. The quiz should take you no more than 5 minutes to answer and will be open till Friday 9:59 PM.<br><br>

  <strong> Exams</strong>. There will be three non-cumulative exams. The first two will be
  held in the discussion sections, the last one will be as per
  university schedule.<br><br>

  Exam 1 (26%), Fri, Feb 3rd: Lectures 1 - 7.<br>
  Exam 2 (22%), Fri, Feb 24th: Lectures 8 - 12.<br>
  Exam 3 (24%), University schedule: Lectures 13-18.<br><br>

 <strong>Course policies</strong>: There will be no makeup exams for
  the course. Students who arrive more than <strong>10 minutes</strong> late for an
  exam will not be allowed into the exam and will automatically
receive 0 credit.<br><br>
Regrade requests will only be handled electronically on Gradescope (so
  that you have more time to ask questions in office hours). They should be submitted within a week of
  receiving the graded work; to keep things flowing, requests
later than a week will not be handled.<br><br>
We will use piazza for questions and discussions. Due to the volume, questions related to
  course work will not be answered via email (by me or the TAs). Use
  Piazza instead - this way, others can answer and/or benefit from your questions).<br><br>
Collaboration on homeworks is encouraged, but each student must write their solutions independently and
should clearly mention the collaborators. You should never share
your written solutions with someone else or copy from someone else's
written solutions. Keep in mind that attempting the homeworks
itself will get you reasonable partial credit and will go a long way
towards good performance in the exams. Under no circumstances may you use solution sets to
problems from previous year courses or from similar courses elsewhere
or other resoruces on the web. 
<br><br>

   <strong> Homework submission</strong> We will use <a
  href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a> for homework and
  they have to be submitted by 7PM on their due date. This
  is extremely helpful both for me as well as for you -
  you'll get better feedback and will have a digital record of
  all your homework that you can refer to later. Things to keep in mind: 1) Within a week of the course,
  you should receive a registration link from Gradescope. If you don't
  receive it before the first homework, contact the TAs immediately;
  this will give you access to the website. 2) Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wemznvGPfg">this</a> one-minute
  video with complete instructions. Follow them to the letter! The
  simple guidelines make the process considerably smoother. 3) Make
  sure you start each problem of a homework on a new page. 4) To
  generate a PDF scan of the assignments, you can follow the instructions
  <a href="submitting_hw_guide.pdf">here</a>; you can also use the
scanners in the library.<br><br>

<strong>Homework writing</strong> It is strongly recommended to use LaTeX or other word
  processing software for submitting the homework. Grades will take
  into account both the correctness and the quality of the
  solutions. Correctness is a prerequisite but clarity is also
  important: you are responsible for communicating your solution in a
legible and understandable way.<br><br>

Some helpful guidelines: (1) Start
  early to use office hours. (2) Serious/honest attempts count - there
  will be reasonable partial credit for attempts that show
understanding of the problem/concepts involved.<br><br>


<strong>Syllabus and lecture plan</strong><br>
The syllabus will be broken up as follows. A tentative lecture plan
  including homework dates is in the calendar above.
  <ul>
    <li> Introduction: 1 lecture</li>
    <t> Logistics. What is an algorithm? Multiplication, Asymptotic analysis.</t>
    <li> Divide and Conquer: 2 lectures</li>
    <t>Merge-sort, master theorem, Karatsuba multiplication, fast exponentiation.</t>
    <li> Graph algorithms: 2 lectures </li>
    Graphs and connectivity. Breadth-first search. Depth-first
    search. Finding cycles in graphs.
    <li> Greedy algorithms: 2 lectures</li>
    Interval scheduling. Minimum spanning trees.
    <li> Dynamic programming: 3 lectures</li>
    General framework. Sequence alignment, knapsack, LCS.
    <li> Randomization to gain speed: 3 lectures</li>
    Randomized divide & conquer: quick-sort, quick-select. Dictionary
    data structure.
    <li> Linear programming: 2 lectures</li>
    Basic model and applications.
    <li> Intractability: 2 lectures</li>
    P, NP, Reductions.
    <li> Miscellaneous/Review: 1 lecture</li>
</ul>
<strong>Academic honesty</strong>: While collaboration with other students on
assignments is fine, each student must write their solutions independently and
should clearly mention the collaborators. Keep in mind that it is
emphatically in your best interest to attempt the problems honestly: not spending
time on the homework problems will put you at a significant
disandvantage in the exams (as you would
not have had much practice) that carry
significantly more weight.

You should never share
your written solutions with someone else or copy from someone else's
written solutions. Under no circumstances may you use solution sets to
problems from previous year courses or from similar courses elsewhere
or other resoruces on the web. <br><br>

The students are expected to fully
abide by UCLA's student conduct <a
href="http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/soc/notices.htm">policies</a>,
including Section 102.01 on academic honesty. You will find a wealth
of helpful materials <a
href="http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/dos/students/integrity/">here</a>,
including the <a
href="http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/dos/assets/documents/StudentGuide.pdf">Student
Guide to Academic Integrity</a>. Academic dishonesty will be promptly
reported to the Dean of Students' Office for adjudication and
disciplinary action. Remember, cheating will have significant and
irrevocable consequences for your academic record and professional
future. Please don't cheat.
