  We will use piazza for the course (to ask/answer questions, to post
  announcements, homework etc.,). You can signup <a
  href="http://piazza.com/ucla/spring2018/cs180">here</a>. The class
  page is <a href="http://piazza.com/ucla/spring2018/cs180/home">here</a>.
  <br><br>

  <strong>Course goals</strong><br>   The course will cover the basics of design and analysis of algorithms. The primary goal of the course is to develop ''algorithmic thinking''. Along the way we will learn some of the core algorithmic techniques and concrete algorithms that underlie much of computer science; we will cover some very important and blazingly fast algorithms. The course will be both challenging (as evidenced by the incomplete list of topics below) and exciting! For an idea, you can check the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/sssyne0sdf1mkqz/cs180w17.pdf?dl=0">'transcript'</a> of the course from Winter 2017. 
  <br><br>

  <strong> Homework (6 x 3%)</strong>. There will be six assignments each worth 3 points. The assignments will be released on a Monday and all but the last will be due at 6PM the following Monday; the last assignment will be due on 6PM the Friday of the same week (so that you have time to review the solutions for the final). <br><br>
	Tentative scopes of the assignments: 1 - Lectures
  1-3; 2 - Lectures 4-5; 3 - Lectures 6-8; 4 - Lectures 9-11; 5 -
  Lectures 12-14; 6 - Lectures 15-17.<br><br>

  <strong> Quizzes (10 x 1%)</strong>. There will be a short weekly
  online quiz that will go live on CCLE every Wednesday at 6PM. The quiz should take you about 5 minutes to answer and will be open till Friday 6PM.<br><br>

  <strong> Exams</strong>. There will be three non-cumulative exams (22%, 25%, 25%). The first two will be
  held in class, the last one will be as per
  university schedule. The exams will be closed-book and closed-notes.<br><br>

  Exam 1, April 25th: Lectures 1 - 5.<br>
  Exam 2, May 16th: Lectures 6 - 11.<br>
  Exam 3, June 11 (3-5): Lectures 12-17.<br><br>

 <strong>Course policies</strong>: There will be no makeup exams for
  the course. Students who arrive more than <strong>15 minutes</strong> late for an
  exam will not be allowed into the exam and will automatically
receive 0 credit.<br><br>
Regrade requests need to be submitted electronically on Gradescope. They should be submitted within a week of
  receiving the graded work; late requests will
not be handled (mainly to keep things flowing).<br><br>
We will use piazza for questions and discussions. Questions related to
  assignments will not be answered via email - use Piazza (so that
others can also benefit from your questions).<br><br>
Collaboration on homeworks is encouraged, but each student must write their solutions independently and
should clearly mention the collaborators. You should never share
your written solutions with someone else or copy from someone else's
written solutions. Under no circumstances may you use solution sets to
problems from previous year courses or from similar courses elsewhere
or other resoruces on the web. Keep in mind that just attempting the homeworks
itself will get you reasonable partial credit and will go a long way
towards better performance in the exams (which carry significantly more weight).
<br><br>

   <strong> Homework submission</strong> We will use <a
  href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a> for homework and
  they have to be submitted by 6PM on their due date. This
  is extremely helpful both for me as well as for you -
  you'll get better feedback and will have a digital record of
  all your homework that you can refer to later. Things to keep in mind: 1) Within a week of the course,
  you should receive a registration link from Gradescope. If you don't
  receive it before the first homework, contact the TAs immediately;
  this will give you access to the website. 2) Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wemznvGPfg">this</a> one-minute
  video with complete instructions. Follow them to the letter! The
  simple guidelines make the process considerably smoother. 3) Make
  sure you start each problem of a homework on a new page. 4) To
  generate a PDF scan of the assignments, you can follow the instructions
  <a href="submitting_hw_guide.pdf">here</a>; you can also use the
scanners in the library.<br><br>

<strong>Homework writing</strong> It is strongly recommended to use LaTeX or other word
  processing software for submitting the homework. Grades will take
  into account both the correctness and the quality of the
  solutions. Correctness is a prerequisite but clarity is also
  important: you are responsible for communicating your solution in a
legible and understandable way.<br>

Some helpful guidelines: (1) Start
  early to use office hours. (2) Serious/honest attempts count - there
  will be reasonable partial credit for attempts that show
understanding of the problem/concepts involved.<br><br>


<strong>Syllabus and lecture plan</strong><br>
The syllabus will be broken up as follows. A tentative lecture plan
  including homework dates is in the calendar above.
  <ul>
    <li> Introduction: 1 lecture</li>
    <t> Logistics. What is an algorithm? Multiplication, Asymptotic analysis.</t>
    <li> Divide and Conquer: 2 lectures</li>
    <t>Merge-sort, master theorem, Karatsuba multiplication, fast exponentiation.</t>
    <li> Graph algorithms: 2 lectures </li>
    Graphs and connectivity. Breadth-first search. Depth-first
    search. Finding cycles in graphs.
    <li> Greedy algorithms: 3 lectures</li>
    Interval scheduling. Minimum spanning trees.
    <li> Dynamic programming: 3 lectures</li>
    General framework. Sequence alignment, knapsack, LCS.
    <li> Randomization to gain speed: 3 lectures</li>
    Randomized divide & conquer: quick-sort, quick-select. Dictionary
    data structure.
    <li> Intractability: 3 lectures</li>
    P, NP, Reductions.
</ul>
<strong>Academic honesty</strong>: While collaboration with other students on
assignments is fine, each student must write their solutions independently and
should clearly mention the collaborators. Keep in mind that it is
emphatically in your best interest to attempt the problems honestly: not spending
time on the homework problems will put you at a significant
disandvantage in the exams (as you would
not have had much practice) that carry
significantly more weight.

You should never share
your written solutions with someone else or copy from someone else's
written solutions. Under no circumstances may you use solution sets to
problems from previous year courses or from similar courses elsewhere
or other resoruces on the web. <br><br>

The students are expected to fully
abide by UCLA's student conduct <a
href="http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/soc/notices.htm">policies</a>,
including Section 102.01 on academic honesty. You will find a wealth
of helpful materials <a
href="http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/dos/students/integrity/">here</a>,
including the <a
href="http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/dos/assets/documents/StudentGuide.pdf">Student
Guide to Academic Integrity</a>. Academic dishonesty will be promptly
reported to the Dean of Students' Office for adjudication and
disciplinary action. Remember, cheating will have significant and
irrevocable consequences for your academic record and professional
future. Please don't cheat.
