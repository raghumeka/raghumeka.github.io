  <strong>Course goals</strong><br>   The course will cover the basics of design and analysis of algorithms. The primary goal of the course is to develop ''algorithmic thinking''. Along the way we will learn some of the core algorithmic techniques and concrete algorithms that underlie much of computer science; we will cover some very important and blazingly fast algorithms. The course will be both challenging (as evidenced by the incomplete list of topics below) and exciting! 
  <br><br>
  <strong> Homework (6 x 4%) </strong><br>
The assignments will be posted to CCLE on Mondays
  at 6:30 PM and will be due the following Monday by 11:59 PM. We will
  use <a href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a> for this
  course. Please follow the instructions below. TAs will return the
  graded homework and go over the solutions in the discussion section
  the following Friday. Solutions to selected problems will be
  uploaded to CCLE. It is highly recommended to start on the
  homework on Monday itself to utilize the office hours. <br><br>
  Homework Grading. Homework will be graded both on effort as well as
  correctness: 100% for a correct solution; 85% for a serious
  good-faith attempt; 70% for a reasonable attempt; 50% for attempting
  and understanding the question. Please attempt the problems
  seriously; this will be very helpful for the exams as well. Late
  submissions will receive zero credit. Regrading questions should be
  brought up within one week of receiving the graded homework
  and will not be addressed otherwise.<br><br>

  <strong> Homework submission </strong><br> We will use <a
  href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a> for the homework. This
  is extremely helpful both for us (the graders) as well as for you -
  you'll get better feedback and will have a digital record of
  all your assignments that you can refer to later. First things: 1) Within a week of the course,
  you should receive a registration link from Gradescope. If you don't
  receive it before the first homework, contact the TAs immediately;
  they will give you access to the website. 2) Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wemznvGPfg">this</a> one-minute
  video with complete instructions. Follow them to the letter! The
  simple guidelines make the process considerably smoother. 3) Make
  sure you start each problem of an assignment on a new page. 4) To
  generate a PDF scan of the assignments, you can follow the instructions
  <a href="submitting_hw_guide.pdf">here</a>; you can also use the scanners in the library.<br><br>

<strong> Quizzes (9 x 1%)</strong><br> There will be a short weekly quiz that will go online on CCLE every Wednesday at 6PM. The quiz should take you no more than 5 minutes to answer and will be open till Friday 9:59 AM.<br><br>

<strong> Mid-term (30%)</strong><br> There will be one mid-term that
will take place in-class on May 2nd. There will be no makeup exams for the class; contact me within the first two weeks of the class if you have an issue with the date.<br><br>

<strong> Final (37%)</strong><br> There will be a cumulative final as per the allotted
  university schedule.<br><br>

<strong>Syllabus and lecture plan</strong><br>
The syllabus will be broken up as follows. A detailed lecture plan
  including homework dates is in the calendar.
  <ul>
    <li> Introduction: 1 lecture</li>
    <t> Logistics. What is an algorithm? Multiplying numbers.</t>
    <li> Divide and Conquer: 2.5 lectures</li>
    <t>Karatsuba multiplication, merge-sort, fast exponentiation,
    asymptotic analysis, Master theorem</t>
    <li> Randomization: 3 lectures</li>
    Randomized divide & conquer: quick-sort, quick-select. Dictionary
    data structure.
    <li> Graph algorithms: 2.5 lectures </li>
    Graphs and connectivity. Breadth-first search. Depth-first
    search. Finding cycles in graphs.
    <li> Greedy algorithms: 2 lectures</li>
    Interval scheduling. Minimum spanning trees.
    <li> Dynamic programming: 3 lectures</li>
    General framework. Sequence alignment, knapsack, LCS.
    <li> Linear programming: 2 lectures</li>
    Basic model and applications.
    <li> Intractability: 2 lectures</li>
    P, NP, Reductions.
</ul>
<strong>Academic honesty</strong><br>
While collaboration with other students on
assignments is fine, each student must write their solutions independently and
should clearly mention the collaborators. Keep in mind that it is
emphatically in your best interest to attempt the problems honestly: not spending
time on the homework problems will put you at a significant
disandvantage in the exams (as you would
not have had much practice) that carry
significantly more weight.

You should never share
your written solutions with someone else or copy from someone else's
written solutions. Under no circumstances may you use solution sets to
problems from previous year courses or from similar courses elsewhere
or other resoruces on the web. <br><br>

The students are expected to fully
abide by UCLA's student conduct <a
href="http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/soc/notices.htm">policies</a>,
including Section 102.01 on academic honesty. You will find a wealth
of helpful materials <a
href="http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/dos/students/integrity/">here</a>,
including the <a
href="http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/dos/assets/documents/StudentGuide.pdf">Student
Guide to Academic Integrity</a>. Academic dishonesty will be promptly
reported to the Dean of Students' Office for adjudication and
disciplinary action. Remember, cheating will have significant and
irrevocable consequences for your academic record and professional
future. Please don't cheat.
