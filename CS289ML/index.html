  <font size="4"> In this course we will look at a handful of
  ubiquitous algorithms in machine learning. We will cover several classical tools in
  machine learning but more emphasis will be given to recent
  advances and developing efficient and provable algorithms for
  learning tasks. A tentative syllabus/schedule can be found below; the topics
  may change based on student interests as well.
  <br><br>
  
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> You <strong> need</strong>
  background in linear algebra, probability theory, and algorithms
  (all at a typical undergraduate upper-division level) to make the
  class fun and interesting for you as well as for me. If you have
  doubts about this please talk to me right away. <br><br>

  <strong>Course work:</strong> We will have four assignments
  (12%x4). <br><br>
  Mid-term - 27%.<br><br>
  Project - 25%.   <br><br>

 <strong> Assignment submission:</strong> We will use <a
  href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a> for assignments and
  they have to be submitted by 10PM on their due date. This
  is extremely helpful both for me as well as for you -
  you'll get better feedback and will have a digital record of
  all your assignments that you can refer to later. Things to keep in mind: 1) Within a week of the course,
  you should receive a registration link from Gradescope. If you don't
  receive it before the first homework, contact me immediately;
  this will give you access to the website. 2) Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wemznvGPfg">this</a> one-minute
  video with complete instructions. Follow them to the letter! The
  simple guidelines make the process considerably smoother. 3) Make
  sure you start each problem of an assignment on a new page. 4) To
  generate a PDF scan of the assignments, you can follow the instructions
  <a href="submitting_hw_guide.pdf">here</a>; you can also use the
scanners in the library.<br><br>

 <strong> Project:</strong> The final project can either be a cohesive literature survey of a
  specific topic, a research project, or an experimental project
  investigating different algorithms on a specific learning
  problem; it can even be in the form of participating in some
  machine learning competitions. The project will be evaluated on the
  basis of a five page (one-sided) report which is
  expected to be at the level of a conference submission. The project
  can be done in teams of upto three students (the work will have to
  scale accordingly).<br><br>

  <strong>Academic honesty</strong>: The students are expected to fully
abide by UCLA's student conduct <a
href="http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/soc/notices.htm">policies</a>,
including Section 102.01 on academic honesty. You will find a wealth
of helpful materials <a
href="http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/dos/students/integrity/">here</a>,
including the <a
href="http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/dos/assets/documents/StudentGuide.pdf">Student
Guide to Academic Integrity</a>. Academic dishonesty will be promptly
reported to the Dean of Students' Office for adjudication and
disciplinary action. Remember, cheating will have significant and
irrevocable consequences for your academic record and professional
future. Please don't cheat.

<br><br>While collaboration with other students on
assignments is fine, you should clearly mention the collaborators. You
should make your own slides and when you use content from another
source, you should explicitly state so. Under no circumstances may you use code directly from resources on the web without explicitly citing the source.<br><br>
