  <font size="4"> In this course we will look at a handful of
  ubiquitous algorithms in machine learning. We will cover several classical tools in
  machine learning but more emphasis will be given to recent
  advances and developing efficient and provable algorithms for
  learning tasks. A tentative syllabus/schedule can be found below; the topics
  may change based on student interests as well.

  <strong>Assignments:</strong><br>
  <a
  href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/y6x0cl3fhjnqlpl/assignment1.pdf?dl=0">Assignment
  1</a>. Due October 18th, 10PM via Gradescope.<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3g6rtza9f692kze/assignment2.pdf?dl=0">Assignment 2</a>. Due November 8th, 10PM via Gradescope.<br><br>

  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> You <strong> need</strong>
  background in linear algebra, probability theory, and algorithms
  (all at a typical undergraduate upper-division level) to make the
  class fun and interesting for you as well as for me. You can judge
  your background with this <a href="assignment0.pdf">problem set</a> (not to be submitted). If you have
  doubts about this please talk to me right away. <br><br>

  <strong>Course work:</strong> We will have four assignments: 1,2,3 -
  18; 4 - 20. <br><br>
  Mid-term - 30. In class on November 20. There will be no make up
  exams for the class; you have to let me know in the first two weeks
  if the date is an issue for you.<br><br>
  Optional project: If you so desire, you can substitute the last
  assignment for an approved project. This can either be a cohesive literature
  survey of a specific topic, a research project, or an experimental
  project investigating different algorithms on a specific learning
  problem; it can even be in the form of participating in some machine
  learning competitions. Projects finding connections between the
  course material and their own research interests are strongly encouraged.<br>

  The project topic has to be finalized before Nov 29th and will be
  evaluated on the basis of a five page (one-sided) report (Due by
  December 14th 5PM PST) which is expected to be at the level of a
  conference submission. The project can be done in teams of up to two students (the work will have to scale accordingly).<br><br>

 <strong> Assignment submission:</strong> We will use <a
  href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a> for assignments and
  they have to be submitted by 10PM on their due date. This
  is extremely helpful both for me as well as for you -
  you'll get better feedback and will have a digital record of
  all your assignments that you can refer to later. Things to keep in mind: 1) Within two weeks of the course,
  you should receive a registration link from Gradescope. If you don't
  receive it before the first homework, contact me immediately;
  this will give you access to the website. 2) Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wemznvGPfg">this</a> one-minute
  video with complete instructions. Follow them to the letter! The
  simple guidelines make the process considerably smoother. 3) Make
  sure you start each problem of an assignment on a new page. 4) To
  generate a PDF scan of the assignments, you can follow the instructions
  <a href="submitting_hw_guide.pdf">here</a>; you can also use the
scanners in the library.<br><br>

  <strong>Academic honesty</strong>: The students are expected to fully
abide by UCLA's student conduct <a
href="http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/soc/notices.htm">policies</a>,
including Section 102.01 on academic honesty. You will find a wealth
of helpful materials <a
href="http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/dos/students/integrity/">here</a>,
including the <a
href="http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/dos/assets/documents/StudentGuide.pdf">Student
Guide to Academic Integrity</a>. Academic dishonesty will be promptly
reported to the Dean of Students' Office for adjudication and
disciplinary action. Remember, cheating will have significant and
irrevocable consequences for your academic record and professional
future. Please don't cheat.

<br><br>While collaboration with other students on
assignments is fine, you should clearly mention the collaborators. You
should make your own slides and when you use content from another
source, you should explicitly state so. Under no circumstances may you use code directly from resources on the web without explicitly citing the source.<br><br>
